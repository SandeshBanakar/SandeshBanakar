👋 Hi, I’m @SandeshBanakar

⚙️ I'm a Mechanical Engineer by qualification. I love coding because of its power, use, and scalability. I am a noob too!

👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Web Development with an acute angle inclination towards front-end.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- JDBC
- Java
- JavaScript
- SQL
- A pinch of Python

Softwares I'm currently practicing coding are:
- Visual Studio Code
- Netbeans IDE
- Eclipse IDE
- Github Copilot

🏎️ I’m looking to collaborate on any simple side-project that helps me learn as a beginner. Project categories may include: Design of smart mechanical components, smart cars, electric vehicle sensor design and data analytics, agriculture-based smart equipments, and intuitive web applications.
